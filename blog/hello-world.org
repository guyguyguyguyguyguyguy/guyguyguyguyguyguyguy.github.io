* Introduction

Welcome to my new blog built with Org mode!

This is my first post using Emacs and Org mode as a static site generator.

* Why Org Mode?

Org mode provides:
- Great writing experience
- Powerful export capabilities
- Built-in publishing system
- Extensible with Emacs Lisp

* Next Steps

I plan to:
1. Add more styling
2. Create custom export functions
3. Add RSS feed generation
4. Implement margin notes like in the example
